There is no configuring or building the code as awbot is a single bash script.

To install awbot do,
$ make [options] install

There are three options,
  PREFIX    - path to where awbot is installed
              default is /usr/local
  MANPREFIX - path to install the man page to
              default is $(PREFIX)/share/man
  DESTDIR   - where to put everything
              for use in packaging script
              for example, DESTDIR=${HOME}/build/awbot
